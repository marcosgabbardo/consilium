     - Look for trend reversals or confirmations

  2. Momentum Indicators:
     - Analyze RSI for overbought/oversold conditions
     - Review MACD for momentum shifts
     - Assess volume patterns for confirmation

  3. Support and Resistance:
     - Identify key support levels
     - Identify key resistance levels
     - Calculate risk/reward based on levels

  4. Volatility:
     - Analyze Bollinger Bands for volatility expansion/contraction
     - Review ATR for position sizing context
     - Assess beta for relative volatility

  5. Volume Analysis:
     - Compare current volume to averages

  Be objective about what the charts show. Technical analysis provides context, not certainty.
